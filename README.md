# üé¨ SQL Mastery with Sakila  
**Final Evaluation of Module 2** | Data Analytics Bootcamp  

## Description  
This repository contains my solutions to the final evaluation exercises for Module 2 of the Adalab Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this module, we worked with the Sakila database, a simulation of a movie rental store.  

The project involved solving a series of SQL queries to explore various aspects of the Sakila database, such as movies, actors, categories, and rentals.

## üìù Exercises  
1. Retrieve unique movie titles.  
2. Find movies with a "PG-13" rating.  
3. List movies with the word "amazing" in their description.  
4. Select movies with a runtime greater than 120 minutes.  
5. Display the names of all actors.  
6. Find actors with the last name "Gibson."  
7. Retrieve actors with IDs between 10 and 20.  
8. List movies that are neither rated "R" nor "PG-13."  
9. Count movies by rating.  
10. Calculate the total movies rented by each customer.  
11. Count movies rented by category.  
12. Determine the average runtime of movies by rating.  
13. List actors in the movie "Indian Love."  
14. Retrieve movies containing "dog" or "cat" in their description.  
15. Find actors who do not appear in any movie.  
16. Select movies released between 2005 and 2010.  
17. List movies from the same category as "Family."  
18. Retrieve actors featured in more than 10 movies.  
19. Find "R"-rated movies with a runtime over 2 hours.  
20. List categories with an average runtime greater than 120 minutes.  
21. Identify actors who have appeared in at least 5 movies.  
22. Retrieve movies rented for more than 5 days.  
23. Find actors who have not acted in "Horror" movies.  
24. Select comedy movies with a runtime exceeding 180 minutes.  
25. List pairs of actors who have appeared together in at least one movie.
